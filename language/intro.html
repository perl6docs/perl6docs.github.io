    <p class='subtitle'>Using Perl&nbsp;6 official documentation</p>
    
    <div class="pod-body no-toc">
    <p>Documenting a large language like Perl&nbsp;6 has to balance several contradictory goals, such as being brief whilst being comprehensive, catering to professional developers with wide experience whilst also being accessible to newcomers to the language.</p>
<p>For a quick hands-on introduction, there is a short <a href="/language/101-basics"><code>annotated programming example</code></a>.</p>
<p>For programmers with experience in other languages, there are a number of <strong>Migration</strong> guides that compare and contrast the features of Perl6 with other languages.</p>
<p>A number of <strong>Tutorials</strong> cover several areas in which Perl6 is particularly innovative. The section headers should help navigate the remaining documents.</p>
<p>There are a number of <a href="https://perl6.org/resources"><code>useful resources</code></a> listed elsewhere on the perl6.org site. These include articles, books, slide presentations, and videos.</p>
<p>It has been found that newcomers to Perl&nbsp;6 often ask questions that indicate assumptions carried over from other programming paradigms. It is suggested that the following sections in the <code>Fundamental topics</code> section should be reviewed first.</p>
<ul><li><p><a href="/type/Signature"><code>Signatures</code></a> - each routine, which includes subroutines and methods, has a signature. Understanding the information given in the signature of a <code>sub</code> or <code>method</code> provides a quick way to grasp the operation and effect of the routine.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="/language/containers"><code>Containers</code></a> - variables, which are like the nouns of a computer language, are containers in which information is stored. The first letter in the formal name of a container, such as the &#39;$&#39; of $my-variable, or &#39;@&#39; of @an-array-of-things, or &#39;%&#39; of %the-scores-in-the-competition, conveys information about the container. However, Perl6 is more abstract than other languages about what can be stored in a container. So, for example, a $scalar container can contain an object that is in fact an array.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="/language/classtut"><code>Classes and Roles</code></a> - Perl&nbsp;6 is fundamentally based on objects, which are described in terms of classes and roles. Perl&nbsp;6, unlike some languages, does not <strong>impose</strong> object-oriented programming practices, and useful programs can be written as if Perl&nbsp;6 was purely procedural in nature. However, complex software, such as the Rakudo compiler of Perl&nbsp;6, is made much simpler by writing in object-oriented idioms, which is why the Perl&nbsp;6 documentation is more easily understood by reviewing what a class is and what a role is. Without understanding about Classes and Roles, it would be difficult to understand Types, to which a whole section of the documentation is devoted.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="/language/traps"><code>Traps to Avoid</code></a> - Several common assumptions lead to code that does not work as the programmer intended. This section identifies some. It is worth reviewing when something doesn&#39;t quite work out.</p>
</li>
</ul>
